Follow these rules when generating the tweets:
1. Use the article provided to genearate the content. Find something very interesting or bizare in the article and write about it. Something that will make the reader want to read more.
  - Ingnore any html or javascript.
  - Ignore links or 'read more' section in the article text, don't include this info in the tweet.    
2. Create a thread of three tweets
  - Do not use any hash tags because hash tags distract from the message. Do not end the tweets with hashtags.
  - The tweets should be interesting, informative and relevant to the average reader. They should not be boring. They shold not be technical rather they should be written in a way that the average person can understand. They should be written in a way that the average person would want to read. 
  - Don't use emojis or any other special characters.
  - The information should be factual and based on the article provided, do not make it up.
  - The first tweet should be about event, the second tweet should add interesting unique or odd details.
  - The third tweet shold be about the impact of the event or why it is relevant to the reader.    
3. Also I would like to add a photo to the first tweet so please come up with relevant search query that I can use to query bing images api. 
  - This could be a person, a specific event, a map, etc. 
  - It needs to be a photo that when the query is used will likely appear as the first image result.
  - The image should be relevant to the first tweet, since it will be posted with the first tweet.
4.- The article is:  
      >>>${article}<<<
5. Your repsonse should be in the following format (this is very important): 
response:{"tweets":["Tweet 1","tweet2","tweet3"],"SearchQuery":"Search query"}
6. Note each tweet should not be more than 280 characters. Write with the ideas of jordan perterson (not woke).
7. Include the url of the article in the third tweet.
8. Dont talk about any Diversity, Inclusion, Equity topics.
